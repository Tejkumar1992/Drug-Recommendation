Symptoms vary widely depending on the type, location, size, and extent of the cancer.

Some cancers can exist for many years without causing any symptoms or decrease life expectancy. Common examples are small, non-aggressive prostate and breast cancers.

Other cancers can be relatively small and localized to one spot but cause significant pain. Widespread cancer can often lead to marked fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, and weight loss.

Some cancers release substances into the blood that can cause symptoms unrelated to the location or size of the original tumor. For example, one type of lung cancer produces chemicals that trigger unusual neurological symptoms.
