The Affordable Care Act gradually phases out the coverage gap by requiring drug makers to give enrollees discounts. This year, the discount is 50 percent of the cost of the drug. Even though enrollees are not paying that discounted amount out of their own pockets, the ACA allowed the dollar value to count toward the $4,850 threshold for catastrophic coverage to begin. Since the ACA took effect, the number of Medicare Part D enrollees who reach the catastrophic coverage level has grown from 400000 in 2010 to 700 by 2013, according to MedPAC. That costs Medicare and taxpayers more because the program pays 80 percent of the costs for drugs after enrollees go through the coverage gap.
Under the commission's proposal, enrollees would no longer be allowed to count those drug maker discounts toward the total, meaning it would take longer to hit the out-of-pocket cap. Indeed, about half of enrollees might not reach the threshold in a given year and not benefit from the 100 percent coverage, notes the report.
"For many people, this will actually increase spending," said Caroline Pearson of consulting firm Avalere in Washington, D.C., which is in the process of analyzing the financial impacts of the MedPAC proposals. "While our results aren't finalized yet, our generalized finding is that a small number of beneficiaries would save a lot of money … but a lot would spend more."
A new Medicare proposal would create drug price controls that do more harm than good for .
Other elements of the proposal would affect insurers. MedPAC recommends insurers shoulder more of the cost of prescriptions after enrollees exit the doughnut hole. That would encourage insurers to try to keep enrollees from hitting the coverage gap's upper limit by getting them to choose lower-cost drugs or by driving harder bargains with drug makers, said Mark Miller, executive director of the commission.
"A good portion of that payment is because beneficiaries are either using more expensive drugs or the prices of their drugs are going up relatively aggressively," said Miller. "We're trying to say … you're going to want to negotiate as tough prices as you can."
MedPAC says the proposals are needed because rising drug prices and other factors helped drive spending in the program to $73 billion in 2014 – and more high-cost drugs will hit the market soon. Without action, the rising costs could drive up program costs and probably premiums for enrollees, MedPAC said.
When MedPAC adopted its recommendations unanimously this spring, they drew mixed reviews and many comments from the drug industry, consumer groups and insurers. All groups found elements they liked in the plans and parts they opposed.
$3B in Cancer Drugs Thrown Away
Smaller packaging could cut spending on cancer drugs by $3 billion, according to a new report.
Little change was seen in the final version released to Congress.
"PhRMA remains concerned about the sweeping recommendations MedPAC approved in April and opposes changes to Medicare Part D that taken together could harm beneficiaries by eroding coverage and protections for many of the most vulnerable enrollees in the program," said Allyson Funk, spokeswoman for the drug industry's trade group PhRMA.
Some proposals have been rejected before, but the report could spark discussion under a new administration and Congress in 2017.
"Once MedPAC makes a recommendation, it gives it legitimacy," said Sanders. "In future years, we could see the proposals as a starting point for some legislation."
Lawmakers have been searching for solutions to drug spending amid headlines about skyrocketing prices, but a study published Tuesday suggests a fix may be much simpler than anyone thought   requiring drug-makers to sell their products in smaller packages.
If the U.S. were to target the packaging of cancer drugs, in particular, the government,  and private health insurance companies would save nearly $3 billion a year, according to the report, published in the medical journal BMJ. Many of the top-selling cancer medicines in the U.S. only come in one-size vials, even though the amount of drugs they contain is more than what most  need. After administering the dosage, nurses throw away any leftovers, but  and their insurers still must pay for the drug in full.

Not Up For Negotiation
To conduct the study, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the University of Chicago projected the total cost of spending on cancer drugs in 2016 at $18 billion, then examined the top 20 cancer drugs that filled two main criteria   those administered in specific doses according to a  body size, and those only sold in a single packaging size. They looked at how much of each drug was left over, and at the revenue for each drug, finding that about 10 percent of total spending would be wasted. In total, they projected $1.8 billion went to drug companies for medicines that ultimately end up in the trash.
"This is all due to decisions about how much drug companies decide to put in each single dose vial," Dr. Peter Bach, director at the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said in a statement. "They almost certainly realize how these decisions translate into revenue."
Hospitals and doctors also profit from administering the drugs by including a mark-up in a  medical bill every time they are used. These markups, estimated at an average of 22 percent for doctors and 142 percent for hospitals, total an additional $1 billion in spending a year on drugs that go to waste. Much of the burden for paying for these drugs goes to  themselves, to the private insurance companies who cover them, and to Medicare, the government-run program that covers seniors and people who are disabled.
As much as a third of the drug rituximab, which treats lymphomas and leukemias, is projected to be discarded every time it is administered, totaling excess spending of $254 million. About 27 percent to 30 percent of another drug, bortezomib, which multiple myeloma, is projected to be wasted, resulting in excess spending of $309 million. Though bortezomib comes only in 2.5 mg vials in the U.S., in the United Kingdom the drug is sold in 1 mg vials.
Authors of the study point out that leftover drugs are rarely used on other , in part because safety standards only allow for them to be used no more than six hours after the drug has been opened.

When asked about the report, Allyson Funk, senior director of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said in a statement that decisions about a vial's size were tied to how a product was approved, and took into account that different have different needs. She brought attention to the fact that approval of smaller packaging would take months, given that new data would need to be collected and that new packaging would need approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
"Manufacturers are committed to working with FDA and Congress to create a more nimble regulatory approval process that enables manufacturers to modify their products as we learn about the safety, efficacy and manufacturing of new medicines from the real world clinical setting," she said.

Global Cancer Spending Reaches $100B
Smaller packaging is available in European countries, where the government plays a larger role in drug pricing, but the author's studies did not evaluate the impact there. A global spending report by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics released in May 2015 shows that the U.S. spends more on cancer drugs than any other , comprising 42.2 percent of $100 billion in total spending.
Policymakers have been scrutinizing the practices of pharmaceutical companies in recent months, particularly following the release of data that revealed in 2014 the  growth in spending on medicines was double that of other health care sectors – due in large part to expensive specialty drugs that hit the market, many of which are for cancer treatment.
"This is a rare opportunity to lower costs for  and our healthcare system in a manner that cannot adversely affect health outcomes," Bach said.
The Obama administration announced a proposal this month that amounts to backdoor price controls, and it could have significant unintended consequences for the people it was designed to help –.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has proposed to experiment with Medicare Part B's program payment model for prescription drugs administered in a physician's office or hospital out department – like a flu vaccine or an infusion therapy for rheumatoid arthritis or cancer treatments, to name a few.
According to CMS, the purpose of this experiment is to test whether a new Part B drug payment model affects physician and  incentives and steers  to drugs that are more effective or of better value. CMS proposes to divide the test into two phases. Under Phase I, which could start 60 days after the final rule is released, all medical providers in the U.S. participating in the Part B program will be divided into two groups to test the effects of different drug reimbursement payments. Criticisms from across the health care spectrum have emerged, and while researchers typically relish the idea of such a large-scale controlled experiment, it does seem potentially reckless when the experiment involves drugs that are critical to  survival, such as many cancer treatments that are covered under Part B.

Phase II, which could start as early as January 2017, is potentially even scarier. This phase will test something known as value-based purchasing arrangements – arrangements that link payment for medications to  outcomes and cost-effectiveness rather than just the quantity of treatments.
Although CMS is uncertain which specific arrangements it will test, and there are some good ideas in the potential list, some of the possibilities could produce harmful consequences. Namely, value-based purchasing arrangements that set a standard payment rate for a group of similar drug products, such as reference pricing, will effectively act like a price control, because the only way certain drugs will be available is if drug companies agree to offer them at that set rate. And as I explain in a recent study, price controls – whether direct or indirect – are a bad idea for prescription drugs for several reasons.
First, if the set payment rate is calculated as some percentage off current prices – one approach CMS proposes – then drug companies will have an incentive to raise prices. In fact, evidence shows that existing price controls have contributed to higher launch prices of drugs as drug companies act to offset the required percentage rebate.

Second, because the new proposals will only apply to drugs sold under the Medicare Part B program, drug companies have the incentive to charge even higher prices to other noncovered  outside of Medicare to offset the discounts. Indeed, numerous studies and government analyses have concluded that required discounts under Medicaid and Medicare have resulted in increased prices for other consumers as manufacturers seek to offset revenue lost under price controls.

Third, price controls contribute to drug shortages   At a below-market price, the demand for drugs exceeds the amount of drugs that manufacturers are willing or able to sell. Indirect price controls, such as reference pricing, that effectively require drug companies to sell at lower prices could similarly result in drug shortages.

Lastly, price controls hinder innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. On average, brand drug companies will spend $2.6 billion to bring each new drug to market with FDA approval. They must offset these significant costs with revenues earned during the patent period; within 3 months after patent expiry, generic competitors will have al y captured over 70 percent of the brand drugs' market share and significantly eroded their profits. Requiring drug companies to offer drugs under patent at significantly lower prices increases the risk that drug companies will not earn the profits they need to justify their development costs. This will result in pharmaceutical companies spending less money on research and development and developing fewer new lifesaving drugs.

[Wall Street Demands Are Driving Up Drug Prices]
If the CMS proposals are implemented, the unintended consequences of price controls would become reality – higher prices for  outside of Medicare and a potentially devastating squeeze on the research and development pipeline.
While the proposed rule was no doubt intended to help, policymakers should steer clear of any reform that could act as a direct or indirect price control. Failure to do so could ultimately harm the very  the rule is designed to benefit. A far better way to control drug spending would be to seek methods that enhance competition among medications – competition lowers drug prices and spurs innovation as drug suppliers compete for valuable market share.
Jason first became addicted to prescription pills when he was a teen, after a doctor prescribed a powerful drug to his  headaches.
It took care of the , but I found myself taking [the painkillers] even when I didn't have the , because I just enjoyed that euphoric numbness," he says. He’s asked us not to use his last name.
Before too long, he says he was popping 45 prescription pills a day, mostly hydrocodone, a strong painkiller. But he also abused tranquilizers like alprazolam and diazepam.
He says his addiction became so overwhelming that he hit rock bottom   He stole pain medication from his mother, who was dying of bone cancer. "She would cry at me because she was in so much pain, but I had taken her medication,” he says.
That’s what it took for Jason to get help. He’s been in recovery for 11 years.
Commonly Abused Drugs
His path to addiction isn’t unusual. It often starts with a medication prescribed for a medical reason.

"The person had an injury or operation, they got a prescription,” says Peter R. Martin, MD, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University. “They basically liked it and kept on doing it.”

That leads them to become dependent on the drug, needing more and more to get the same effect. “The next step is to go from doctor to doctor to try to get medicine when the original doctor says no,” Martin says.

Jason recalls visiting several doctors in one day to get enough pills to fuel his habit -- a practice called "doctor shopping."

Who Could Be at Risk?
It's hard to know how many people in the U.S. are hooked on prescription drugs. That’s because only overdoses can be easily tracked. But based on those numbers, experts think that more than 8 and half million Americans abuse such meds. And they often start young. About 8% of high-school seniors said they used the painkiller hydrocodone for nonmedical reasons during the past year.

There’s no way to know who will become addicted. Some people use prescription pain pills -- and even misuse them for a short time -- but don’t become hooked.

Drug Abuse

Drug abuse isn't just about street drugs. Besides marijuana, legal medicines are the most commonly abused drugs in the U.S. Over-the-counter and prescription drugs can help and heal us. But some can be addictive and dangerous if they’re used the wrong way.
Keep your family safe. Use this guide to help you spot some commonly misused medicines. Because drugs come in many forms, not all pills and tablets are shown. Drug pictures are not to scale.

Rx Drug Abuse   Common and Dangerous
What are the most abused prescription drugs, and what are the risks?

In the 1970s, parents worried that their longhaired, bell-bottomed teenagers were getting drunk or smoking marijuana. Today, dangers also come in the form of prescription medicines -- from opioid pain relievers such as OxyContin to ADHD drugs such as Ritalin.

Prescription drug abuse appears to be on the rise in this . Wilson Compton, MD, director of the division of epidemiology services and prevention research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), says the reasons aren't clear.

But he suspects that increasing numbers of prescriptions written for certain drugs, such as ADHD medications, afford greater opportunity. "A certain portion of those will be diverted for abuse purposes," he says.

Compton also says that in the current environment it seems almost normal to pop pills. "All of the advertising for pills may play a role in our willingness to try them."

Roughly 6.3 million Americans report that they're currently using prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Commonly Abused Drugs

Prescription drug abuse knows no age. The elderly are vulnerable because they're more likely to take many medications, often long term. Also, women may be as much as 55% more likely as men to be prescribed drugs that can be abused, such as narcotics and tranquilizers; therefore, their risk is greater, according to the NIDA.

Teens and Prescription Drug Abuse
Abuse is most common among young people, Compton says. "Prescription drug abuse -- like most drug abuse -- tends to peak in the teens and 20s," he tells WebMD.

Almost one in five teens -- roughly 4.5 million -- has tried getting high with prescription drugs (typically with pain relievers such as Vicodin or OxyContin, or stimulants, such as Ritalin and Adderall). That's according to a recent national study on teen abuse of prescription and over-the-counter drugs by the nonprofit Partnership for a Drug-Free America.

The study also found that teens' abuse of prescription and over-the-counter medicines is equal to or higher than abuse of drugs such as cocaine and crack, Ecstasy, methamphetamine, and heroin.

Some teens say that prescription medicines are much safer to abuse than illegal drugs. But just because prescription drugs aren't cooked up in someone's garage doesn't mean that they're safe. According to Compton, the main risk for many drugs is addiction.
