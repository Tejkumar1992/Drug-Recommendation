Your doctor will review your medical history and perform a thorough physical examination. He or she will ask about your family history of cancer.

In the initial phase of diagnostic evaluation, blood tests and CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are performed. Depending on the results, follow-up tests may include MRI and PET scans.

Almost always, a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to provide information that will guide prognosis and therapy.
