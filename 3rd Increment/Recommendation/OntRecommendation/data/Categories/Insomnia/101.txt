Your habits and surroundings are the usual causes of short-term insomnia problems. Factors that contribute to insomnia can include:

Stress or anxiety
A change in sleeping environment (being a guest at a hotel or a relative's home)
An uncomfortable sleeping environment (too hot, too cold, too bright, too noisy)
An uncomfortable mattress
Pajamas that are too tight
Having a bed partner who snores or has disruptive sleep patterns
Watching television, reading a book or problem-solving in your bed, so your brain associates lying down in bed without activities other than sleeping
Eating a heavy meal before bedtime
Taking a prescription medication that has insomnia as a side effect
Drinking alcoholic beverages before bedtime
Having a high intake of beverages containing caffeine (coffee, tea, cola) during the day
Cigarette smoking
Exercising immediately before bedtime
Not exercising enough during the day, so you have energy to spare
Taking a hot bath or shower before bed
Traveling to a different time zone
Traveling to a much higher altitude
Shift work
Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to insomnia. Women who are pregnant may have insomnia because of hormone changes, heartburn, leg cramps or a need to urinate more frequently. In addition, the unborn baby's increasing size often makes it harder for the mother to find a comfortable sleeping position.
