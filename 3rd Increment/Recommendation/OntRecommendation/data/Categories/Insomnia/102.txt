Chronic insomnia may be caused by a medical or psychiatric problem. Some common causes of chronic insomnia include:

Psychiatric illness, especially depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Chronic medical illnesses, especially kidney disease, heart failure or asthma
Painful illnesses, especially arthritis, neuropathy, acid reflux or cancer
Hormone imbalance, especially menopause or hyperthyroidism
Taking a prescription medicine that has insomnia as a side effect
Restless legs syndrome -- This disorder causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. Symptoms can include twitching of the legs, a habit of repetitive leg movements, and leg cramps
Obstructive sleep apnea
Sleep apnea is a common condition. However, often the people that have this problem don't realize it. Snorers or people who are overweight may have repeated episodes in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to 30 seconds during sleep, just when the person is relaxing into deep sleep.

Sleep apnea is caused most often by relaxing the tongue and throat tissues, which can settle into a position that closes your airway. Your body reacts to sleep apnea by releasing adrenaline-like "alarm" hormones so you will awaken and resume breathing. These hormones keep you awake for periods of the night.
