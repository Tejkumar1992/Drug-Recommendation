Size of all sorts mattered for James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic, whose magnitude was in all ways unprecedented. Cameron and two studios spent $200 million on a 90% scale Titanic replica at a newly constructed Mexico studio; their efforts included duplicating furnishings from original Titanic designs, diving trips to shoot footage of the wreck with a specially designed underwater camera, and months of post-production on computer effects ranging from overhead "shots" of the Titanic at sea to characters' puffs of freezing breath. Delayed several months and beseiged by negative word-of-mouth, Titanic finally opened to rave reviews, especially for its bravura visuals. A few doubts were expressed over the Jack-Rose romance, but nothing could beat the spectacular recreation of the ship sinking or the powerful image of the floating corpse field. That love story, however, proved a potent draw, as Leonardo Di Caprio fans (many of them teenage girls) came back for repeat viewings, helping to power Titanic to a sojourn of more than 3 months at the top of the U.S. box office; the most expensive film ever made became a titanic moneymaker, grossing over $1.6 billion internationally. Cameron's coronation as blockbuster artist arrived when Titanic received a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations (like 1950's All About Eve) and won a record-tying 11 (like 1959's Ben-Hur). Cameron's screenplay, however, was ignored.
