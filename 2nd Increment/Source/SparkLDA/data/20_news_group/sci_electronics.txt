$3B in Cancer Drugs Thrown Away
Smaller packaging could cut spending on cancer drugs by $3 billion, according to a new report.
Little change was seen in the final version released to Congress.
"PhRMA remains concerned about the sweeping recommendations MedPAC approved in April and opposes changes to Medicare Part D that taken together could harm beneficiaries by eroding coverage and protections for many of the most vulnerable enrollees in the program," said Allyson Funk, spokeswoman for the drug industry's trade group PhRMA.
Some proposals have been rejected before, but the report could spark discussion under a new administration and Congress in 2017.
"Once MedPAC makes a recommendation, it gives it legitimacy," said Sanders. "In future years, we could see the proposals as a starting point for some legislation."
Lawmakers have been searching for solutions to drug spending amid headlines about skyrocketing prices, but a study published Tuesday suggests a fix may be much simpler than anyone thought   requiring drug-makers to sell their products in smaller packages.
If the U.S. were to target the packaging of cancer drugs, in particular, the government,  and private health insurance companies would save nearly $3 billion a year, according to the report, published in the medical journal BMJ. Many of the top-selling cancer medicines in the U.S. only come in one-size vials, even though the amount of drugs they contain is more than what most  need. After administering the dosage, nurses throw away any leftovers, but  and their insurers still must pay for the drug in full.
